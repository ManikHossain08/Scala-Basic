# Scala Programming with SBT
Scala basic from beginner to advance level. This languages is very intuitive to use and less code to write and there is no verbosity like JAVA where we have to write huge amout of code.

This scala will be a good fit for Big Data developers, hopefully in recent few years.

# What is SBT?
- sbt is an open-source build tool for Scala and Java projects, similar to Apache's Maven and Ant.

- Its main features are:

  -- Native support for compiling Scala code and integrating with many Scala test frameworks
  
  -- Continuous compilation, testing, and deployment
  
  -- Incremental testing and compilation (only changed sources are re-compiled, only affected tests are re-run etc.)
  
  -- Build descriptions written in Scala using a DSL
  
  -- Dependency management using Apache Ivy (which supports Maven-format repositories)
  
  -- Integration with the Scala interpreter for rapid iteration and debugging
  
  -- Support for mixed Java/Scala projects
